#Applications of R Vectors
#1.Vectors are used in machine learning for principal component analysis. They are extended to eigenvalues and eigen vector which are then used for performing decomposition in vector spaces.
#When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use c() function which means to combine the elements into a vector.
apple <- c(1,2,3)
print(apple)
banana<-c("red",1,"apple")
print(banana)
print(class(banana))
#Indexing with Integer Vector
print(apple[1])
#Indexing with Character Vector
x<-c("One"=1,"Two"=2,"Three"=3)
x["Two"]
#Indexing with Logic Vector
a<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
a[c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)]
#COMBINING VECTOR IN ARRAY

#addition
a<-c(1,2)

#LOGICAL INDEX VECTOR IN ARRAY

#DUPLICATE INDEX
